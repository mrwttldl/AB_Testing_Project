 :file_folder:  Business Problem
 
-Facebook recently introduced a new type of bidding, average bidding, as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding.

-One of our customers, an e-commerce site, has decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts 
more than maximumbidding.
 
 
 :feet: A/B Test Steps
 
Step 1: set up the hypothesis (write the hypothesis even if you're going to do the test with code)

Step 2: Data preprocessing & exploratory data analysis can be done

Step 3: Do the hypothetical plot review related to the relevant test

Step 4: Calculate the P value, interpret the results.
